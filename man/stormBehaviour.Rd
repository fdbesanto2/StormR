\usage{
stormBehaviour(
  sts,
  product = "MSW",
  method = "willoughby",
  space_res = 0.1,
  time_res = 1,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sts}{Set of storm generated by \code{getStorms} we are interested in}

\item{product}{Characters that represent the product we would like to compute,
currently among \code{MSW} and \code{PDI}.}

\item{method}{Cyclonic model used to compute product. Default value is set to
\code{willoughby}.}

\item{space_res}{Space resolution (in degree) of the incoming raster products.
Default value is set to 0.1 degree.}

\item{time_res}{Time discretization (in hours) to compute the products.
Default value is set to 1h.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, whether or not the function must be verbose. Default
value is set to \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
A raster stack gathering all the results. Names of the layer are
