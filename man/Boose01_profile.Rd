\title{Compute wind values according to the Boose 01 model}
\usage{
Boose01_profile(r, t, rmw, landfall, vmax, Vh, b = 1.3)

\arguments{
\item{r}{Distance to the center of the storm where the value must be computed}

\item{t}{Clockwise angle between forward motion of hurricane and radial line to P}

\item{rmw}{Radius of maximum wind speed. Default value is set to NULL}

\item{landfall}{Minimum distance to land over next 3 hours (=0 means landfall)}

\item{vmax}{Maximum wind speed generated}

\item{Vh}{forward speed of storm}

\item{b}{Scaling factor}
}
\value{
wind value according to the Boose 01 at distance \code{r} to the
center of the storm
